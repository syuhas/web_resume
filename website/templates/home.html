            <h2 style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 10px black;">Hi there.</h2>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: center;">My name is <span
                style="color:#c28422; text-shadow: 5px 5px 10px black; font-size: larger;">Steve</span></p>
        <div class="introtext">
            <p>With a strong passion for IT and cloud computing, I transitioned into the tech field after over a decade
                of dedication to my previous career. In the last two years, I have built a solid foundation in Amazon
                Web Services (AWS), DevOps, and software development, earning multiple AWS certifications and gaining
                hands-on experience in a variety of roles.
            </p>

            <p>Most recently, I spent nearly a year and a half as a Release Engineer and Developer, where I was
                responsible for
            </p>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing and maintaining applications for internal reporting, monitoring tools, and automated IAM
                    role management to streamline operations.</li>
                <li>Managing Jenkins production deployments and troubleshooting issues to ensure smooth and reliable
                    release cycles.</li>
                <li>Leading the development of key automation solutions, such as custom Jira dashboards, AWS Lambda
                    Canary monitoring, and cross-region database replication across 100+ AWS accounts.</li>
                <li>Creating automated reporting to monitor resource utilization and maintain security compliance, as
                    well as solutions using Athena for analyzing S3 usage data.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>These experiences have deepened my expertise in automation, cloud resource management, and CI/CD
                processes. I am continually learning and pushing my skills further through additional studies and
                hands-on projects.
            </p>

            <p>This website serves as a showcase of my journey, a catalog of my projects, and a space for new ideas and
                skills as they develop. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!</p>
