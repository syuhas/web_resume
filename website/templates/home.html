        <h2 style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 10px black;">Welcome.</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">My name is <span style="color:#c28422; text-shadow: 5px 5px 10px black; font-size: larger;">Steve</span>.</p>
        <p>Recently, I decided to make a significant change in my life. I decided to follow my passion and am currently in the process of effecting a career change into the field of I.T. after a decade and a half of dedication to my current profession.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>I found myself particularly drawn towards cloud computing and, over the past year, achieved two certifications in AWS and several related college courses. I am continuing 
            to pursue additional coursework in Computer Science and have supplemented my studies with Udemy courses in Python and cloud adjacent technologies.
        </p>
        
        <p>I created this site from the ground up to catalogue and track my progress and plan to continue growing the site as my knowledge base grows. 
        </p>
        
        <p>I have brought this same dedication, passion, persistence and commitment to my current career and will do the same as I enter the I.T. workforce.
        </p>
        
        <p>Thank you for visiting my site and I look forward to hearing your reactions to it.
        </p>
