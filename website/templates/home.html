        <h2 style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 10px black">Welcome.</h2>
        <p>My name is <span style="color:#c28422; text-shadow: 5px 5px 10px black; font-size: larger;">Steve</span>. Thanks for visiting my site.</p>
        <p>A year ago I decided to make a significant change. I decided to follow my passion for technology and computing and am in the process of effecting a career change into the field after a decade and a half of dedication to my current profession in food service and hospitality as a professional Chef.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>I found myself specifically interested in cloud computing and networking. I followed that interest and achieved two certifications in AWS, completed courses and continue to study Computer Science at university and have supplemented my studies with Udemy courses in Python and Cloud Technologies.
        </p>
        
        <p>I created this site from the ground up to catalogue and track my progress into the industry. I aim to continually grow the site as my own knowledge base grows. 
        </p>
        
        <p>I intend to bring my dedication and passion, as well as persistence and a commitment to continual learning, to wherever my journey leads.
        </p>
        
        <p>Thank you for visiting and I hope to hear from you soon!
        </p>
