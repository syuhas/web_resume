            <p>Iâ€™m Steve. I have a passion for all things IT. Particularly Cloud and even more particularly AWS and DevOps. I am currently in the process of enacting a significant career change in my life from 
                Professional Chef to IT super nerd. I have spent the last year immersing myself various platforms, languages, and technologies and have dedicated myself to a continuing process of learning something new every day. 
                I am currently in school studying for Computer Science, have completed my AWS Solutions Architect Associate, Certified Cloud Practitioner and am currently studying for my third certification.</p>
